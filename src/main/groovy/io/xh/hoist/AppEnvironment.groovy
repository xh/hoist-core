/**
 * Enum describing available application deployment environments.
 *
 * Hoist itself makes no assumptions or guarantees as to how any given app will behave within a
 * given environment.
 *
 * In particular it is strictly up to the application developer to maintain appropriate controls
 * over how data is read/written and to ensure that such decisions are in-line with how that
 * environment is understood to work within the organization. Several "intermediate" environments
 * are enumerated for convenience that won't have a commonly-understood relationship to production.
 *
 * Note this is distinct from the built-in Grails notion of Environments as there may be multiple
 * non-production app instances (e.g., Development, Beta) that all run in Grails "production" mode
 * on their respective servers.
