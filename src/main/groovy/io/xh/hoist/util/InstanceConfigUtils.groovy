/**
 * Utility for loading optional, file-based configuration properties once on startup and exposing
 * them to the application as a map.
 *
 * These are intended to be minimal, low-level configs that apply to a particular deployed instance
 * of the application and therefore are better sourced from a local file/volume vs. source code,
 * JavaOpts, or database-driven ConfigService entries.
 *
 * They are also typically used to provide the connection information and credentials for the
 * primary database connection itself, keeping that sensitive info out of the source code.
 *
 * This utility will consult the `-Dio.xh.hoist.instanceConfigFile` JavaOpt for the full path to one
 * of the following supported locations:
 *
 *      1) A YAML (.yml) file containing key value pairs.
 *      2) A directory containing multiple files, where the file names are loaded as config keys and
 *          their contents are read in as the values.
 *      3) A directory containing a YAML file with the name [appCode].yml.
 *
 * Option (1) is the default if the JavaOpt is not set, with a default location of
 * /etc/hoist/conf/[appCode].yml.
 *
 * Option (2) is intended for use in a Docker environment with configs/secrets mounted to a local
 * path within the container. (This is how Docker exposes configs to the runtime environment.)
 *
 * Option (3) is intended for builds that might or might not be deployed within Docker - allowing
 * for a single "directory style" JavaOpt value to be baked into the Tomcat container and resolve to
 * either a single file or to a directory of Docker configs.
 *
 * Note that all values will be read in and provided as Strings.
 *
 * This utility also establishes the `AppEnvironment`, sourcing it from (in priority order):
 *
 *      1) A `-Dio.xh.hoist.environment` JavaOpt, if provided.
 *      2) Config file/directory entry with key `environment`, if provided.
 *      3) Fallback to Development, if not otherwise specified.
 *
 * The AppEnvironment is made available via its own getter that returns the proper Enum, and is
 * deliberately removed from the instanceConfig map. (The `io.xh.hoist.util.Utils` method is the
 * expected entry point for most app code, anyway.)
 *
 * Note that this class is *not* available for use in application.groovy, as that file is read
 * and processed prior to compilation. It can however be read from within a conf/runtime.groovy
 * file, which can also be used to set core Grails configuration options (as long as they are not
 * needed for any CLI commands you are using). See https://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/conf.html
