/**
 * Marker interface for an exception that is an expected part of the application flow.
 *
 * Hoist may log exceptions of this type minimally or not at all. They primarily exist to provide
 * out-of-band responses from the server to the client. They specifically do NOT indicate unexpected
 * or unhandled bugs in server-side code or processing that should trigger alerts or require fixing.
 *
 * For example usages of this interface within Hoist:
 * @see RoutineRuntimeException
 * @see NotAuthorizedException
 * @see DataNotAvailableException
