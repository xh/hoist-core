 * Exception for use when the authenticated user does not have access to the resource in question.

 * This exception is thrown by Hoist's {@link io.xh.hoist.security.BaseAuthenticationService} if

 * authenticated user does not have roles required by a controller's `@Access` annotation.
 *
 * Applications may also throw this exception, or subclasses of it, directly in response to requests
 * they cannot fulfill due to auth-related constraints.
 *
 * Instances of this exception will be sent to clients with HttpStatus 403 ('Forbidden').
