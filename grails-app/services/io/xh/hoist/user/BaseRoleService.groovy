/**
 * Abstract base service for maintaining a list of HoistUser <-> role assignments, where roles
 * are returned as simple strings and made available to both server and client code.
 *
 * Applications must define a concrete implementation of this service with the name 'RoleService'.
 * Roles should be defined and sourced based on the app's particular needs.
 *
 * By way of example, implementations could:
 *      + Query roles from a database, maintained by this app or externally.
 *      + Query LDAP / AD group memberships, and resolve those to roles.
 *      + Leverage configService to provide quick / built-in storage for role mappings.
 *
 * Hoist has a requirement for only one special role - "HOIST_ADMIN" - which grants access to the
 * built-in admin functions and enables user impersonation via IdentityService.
 *
 * Note that the HoistUser `getRoles()` and `hasRole()` methods serve as the primary application
 * entry-point for verifying roles on a given user, reducing or eliminating any need to call an
 * implementation of this service directly.
