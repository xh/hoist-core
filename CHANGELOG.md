# Changelog

## 29.0-SNAPSHOT - unreleased

* Enhancements to remote

## 28.1.0 - 2025-02-13

### üéÅ New Features

* Added new endpoints to support searching the contents of `JSONBlob` entries, JSON-based user
  preferences, and JSON-based app configs. (A UI for this has been added to the Admin Console in
  `hoist-react >= 72.1`.)
* Added `xhLdapConfig.useMatchingRuleInChain` flag to enable use of `LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* ‚ö†Ô∏èUpdated `LdapService` to no longer use `LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN` by default when resolving
  nested group memberships. The service now uses recursive lookups into child groups, which perform
  better under most conditions. A new `xhLdapConfig.useMatchingRuleInChain` config flag can be used
  to revert to the previous behavior.
* Generally improved the handling of system shutdown - in particular, ensure that if an app's
  Hazelcast instance unexpectedly terminates, the entire app shuts down with it.

### üìö Libraries

* json-patch `added @ 1.13`
* json-path `added @ 2.9`

## 28.0.0 - 2025-01-27

### üí• Breaking Changes (upgrade difficulty: üü¢ LOW - requires Java 17 and Hoist React 72.x)

* Requires Java 17.
* Requires `hoist-react >= 72`
* Minor/patch updates to Groovy, Grails, and Hazelcast (see versions below).

### üéÅ New Features

* Added support for conditional persisting of activity tracking messages based on `TrackSeverity`.
  By default, all messages continue to have severity `INFO`, which is the default active level.
  Make tracking more or less verbose by adding an entry to the new `levels` property of the
  `xhActivityTrackingConfig` app config. See `TrackService.groovy` for more info.

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Fixed unique name validation for `JSONBlob` (and therefore saved View Manager views).

### üìö Libraries

* Grails + Grails Gradle plugin `6.2.0 ‚Üí 6.2.3`
* GORM `8.1.0 ‚Üí 8.1.2`
* Groovy `3.0.21 ‚Üí 3.0.23`
* Hazelcast `5.3.7 ‚Üí 5.5.0`

## 27.0.0 - 2025-01-08

### üí• Breaking Changes (upgrade difficulty: üü¢ LOW - Hoist React update)

* Requires (and required by) `hoist-react >= 71` to support enhanced cluster state monitoring and
  view management features.

### üéÅ New Features

* Added server-side APIs for the new Hoist React `ViewManager` component.
* Improved support for easily comparing state of objects (Hoist and Hazelcast native) across members
  of a cluster. Provided a new `AdminState` interface to support this functionality.

## 26.0.0 - 2024-12-02

### üí• Breaking Changes (upgrade difficulty: üü¢ TRIVIAL - change to runOnInstance signature.)

* Optimized `BaseController.runOnInstance()` and `runOnPrimary()` to perform JSON serialization
  on the target instance. This allows lighter-weight remote endpoint executions that do not require
  object serialization. Note apps must provide a `ClusterJsonRequest` when calling these methods.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Updated built-in logs to follow a consistent format for their filenames:
  `[appCode]-[instanceName]-[app|track|monitor].log`.

## 25.0.0 - 2024-11-15

### üí• Breaking Changes (upgrade difficulty: üü¢ LOW)

* Removed support for dynamic configuration of distributed Hazelcast objects. All configuration
  must be in place before an instance is started, per Hazelcast documentation.
    * Removed `ClusterService.configureXXX` methods, replaced by support for specifying a static
      `ClusterService.configureCluster` closure.
    * Not expected to impact any existing applications.

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Fixed issue where a `Timer` interval specified as an App Config name failed to update dynamically.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Increased max length of `Role.category` string to 100 chars.
* Requires column modification to `xh_role` table with the following SQL or equivalent:

```mysql
-- MySQL
ALTER TABLE `xh_role`
    CHANGE COLUMN `category` `category` VARCHAR(100) null
```

```sql
-- SQL Server
ALTER TABLE xh_role ALTER COLUMN category VARCHAR(100) null
```

## 24.0.0 - 2024-10-17

### üí• Breaking Changes (upgrade difficulty: üü¢ LOW - Hoist React update)

* Requires `hoist-react >= 69` to support revised API for Activity Tracking and User Preference
  POSTs from client.

### üéÅ New Features

* Updated Activity Tracking endpoint to support client POSTing multiple track logs in a single
  request, helping to reduce network overhead for chatty apps.
* Improved the handling of track log timestamps - these can now be supplied by the client and are no
  longer bound to insert time of DB record. Latest Hoist React uses *start* of the tracked activity.
* Support for persisting of memory monitoring results
* New built-in monitor `xhClientErrorsMonitor`
* New methods `MonitorResult.getParam` and `MonitorResult.getRequiredParam`

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Updated behavior of `withInfo` and `withDebug` log utils to print a "started" message if logging
  enabled at `DEBUG` or `TRACE`, respectively. Allows admins to see start messages for more
  important `withInfo` logs, without necessarily printing both lines for all `withDebug` calls.

## 23.0.0 - 2024-09-27

### üí• Breaking Changes (upgrade difficulty: üü¢ LOW)

* Improvements to the efficiency of `CachedValue` for sharing of large objects. This included
  moving to its own package `io.xh.hoist.cachedvalue` for clarity.
* New dynamic configuration for all distributed hazelcast objects. See methods
  `ClusterService.configureXXX`. These methods replace the static map `BaseService.clusterConfigs`.

### üéÅ New Features

* Misc. improvements to logging and performance of `Cache` and `Timer`.
* New configuration property `hoist.sensitiveParamTerms` allows customization of environment
  variables to be obscured in the admin client.

## 22.0.0 - 2024-09-18

### üí• Breaking Changes (upgrade difficulty: üü¢ LOW)

* Updated `Timer`, `Cache`, and `CachedValue` objects to require a `name` property. Names are now
  mandatory to better support new cluster features, logging, and Admin Console tooling.
* Migrated `BaseService` methods `getIMap()`, `getReplicatedMap()` and `getISet()` to
  `createIMap()`, `createReplicatedMap()` and `createISet()`, respectively. Not expected to impact
  most apps, as these APIs are new and only used for distributed, multi-instance data.

### üéÅ New Features

* Added new `BaseService` factories to create `Cache` and `CachedValue` objects. This streamlined
  interface reduces boilerplate and is consistent with `Timer` creation.
* Improved `Timer` to maintain consistent execution timing across primary instance changes.
* Improved `RestController` to support domain objects linked to a non-primary `DataSource`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Enhanced the `xh/environmentPoll` payload to include any active Alert Banner spec. Clients running
  `hoist-react >= 68` will leverage this to avoid an extra polling request.
* Exposed `/xh/ping` as whitelisted route for basic uptime/reachability checks. Retained legacy
  `/ping` alias, but prefer this new path going forward.
* Improved handling + rendering of exceptions during authentication and authorization requests.
* Updated `ClusterService` to use Hoist's `InstanceNotFoundException`, ensuring that common errors
  thrown due to instance changes are marked as routine and don't spam error reporting.
* Added new `BaseService.resources` property to track and provide access to `Cache` objects and
  `Timer`s by name, replacing `BaseService.timers`.

## 21.0.1 - 2024-09-05

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Resolved issue where connected clients would not display the upgrade prompt banner when an app was
  first released with an update to `hoist-core >= 21.0.0`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Improved serialization efficiency of replicated `Cache` and `CachedValue`.

## 21.0.0 - 2024-09-03

### üí• Breaking Changes (upgrade difficulty: üü¢ LOW - latest Hoist React + DB col additions)

* Requires `hoist-react >= 67.0.0`.
* Requires minor DB schema additions (see below).
* `ReplicatedValue` has been replaced with the enhanced `CachedValue`. This new object provides
  all the functionality of the old, plus additional features from the `Cache` API such as expiry,
  `getOrCreate()`, event support, and blocking support for non-primary nodes.
* Migrated previous `xhAppVersionCheck` to new `xhEnvPollConfig`, which now governs a single polling
  interval on the client to check for app version and connected instance changes. The previous
  config's `mode` value will be automatically migrated to the new `onVersionChange` key. A shorter
  default interval of 10s will be set in all cases, to ensure timely detection of instance changes.
* The `/xh/environment` endpoint is no longer whitelisted and requires / will trigger
  authentication flow.

### üéÅ New Features

* Client error reports include new `correlationId` field.
    * ‚ö† NOTE - this requires a new column in the `xh_client_error` table. Review and run the
      following SQL, or an equivalent suitable for the particular database you are using:
      ```sql
      ALTER TABLE `xh_client_error` ADD COLUMN `correlation_id` VARCHAR(100) NULL;
      ```
* Activity tracking logs include new `correlationId` field.
    * ‚ö† NOTE - this requires a new column in the `xh_track_log` table. Review and run the following
      SQL, or an equivalent suitable for the particular database you are using:
      ```sql
      ALTER TABLE `xh_track_log` ADD COLUMN `correlation_id` VARCHAR(100) NULL;
      ```
* `Cache` and the (new) `CachedValue` provide a new common API for (potentially replicated) state
  in services. In particular the following new features are included with common API:
    * Dynamic expiry of values via fluid api
    * New event handling via `addChangeHandler`
    * Improved trace logging of value serialization
    * Offers both replicated and non-replicated modes
* New instance aware methods on `BaseController`: `runOnInstance`, `runOnPrimary` and
  `runOnAllInstances`. These were formerly on `BaseClusterController`, which has been removed.
* New `LdapService.authenticate()` API supports a new way to validate a domain user's credentials by
  confirming they can be used to bind to a configured LDAP server.

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Fixed bug where a role with a dot in its name could not be deleted.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* `LdapService` now binds to configured servers with TLS and supports new `skipTlsCertVerification`
  flag in its config to allow for self-signed or otherwise untrusted certificates.

## 20.4.0 - 2024-07-31

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Fixed sporadic serialization errors on status monitor results with an attached exception.
* Added configurable table name to `xhDbConnectionMonitor` status check to support edge case where
  XH tables are in a custom schema.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Support for bulk updating of Role categories.

## 20.3.1 - 2024-07-23

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Simplified the `xhDbConnectionMonitor` query to work with more SQL dialects.

## 20.3.0 - 2024-07-16

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Improvements to the ability to configure Hibernate 2nd-level caches. See `ClusterConfig` for more
  information.

## 20.2.1 - 2024-07-09

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Remove obsolete, non-functioning GSP support from `EmailService`.

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Fix to regression with `LdapObject` subclasses not fully populating all keys/properties.

## 20.2.0 - 2024-06-26

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Common LDAP attributes `cn`, `displayname`, `mail`, and `name` moved to `LdapObject` class.
* Websockets are now enabled by default. To disable, add `hoist.enableWebSockets = false` to your
  project's `application.groovy` file (note the lowercase "a" to ensure you have the correct one).

## 20.1.0 - 2024-06-21

### üéÅ New Features

* `LdapService.searchOne` and `searchMany` methods have been made public.
* `LdapPerson` class now includes `displayName`, `givenname`, and `sn` fields.

### üêû Bug Fixes

* `LdapPerson` class `email` field changed to `mail` to match LDAP attribute.

## 20.0.2 - 2024-06-05

### üêû Bug Fixes

* `BaseProxyService` now correctly handles responses without content.
* `BaseProxyService` now properly supports caching the underlying `HttpClient` between requests.
  This defaults to `false` to reflect current behavior, but may be overridden to enable.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Removed obsolete `BaseAuthenticationService.whitelistFileExtensions`

## 20.0.1 - 2024-05-21

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Restored routing of status monitor logging to dedicated file.

## 20.0.0 - 2024-05-17

### üéÅ New Features

#### Hoist now fully supports multi-instance, clustered deployments!

Hoist Core v20 provides support for running multi-instance clusters of Hoist application servers.
Cluster management is powered by [Hazelcast](https://hazelcast.com), an open-source library
providing embedded Java support for inter-server communication, co-ordination, and data sharing.

See the new `ClusterService.groovy` service, which provides the clustering implementation and main
API entry point for accessing the cluster.

Many apps will *not* need to implement significant changes to run with multiple instances. Hoist
will setup the cluster, elect a primary instance, provide cluster-aware Hibernate caching and
logging, and ensure cross-server consistency for its own APIs.

However, complex applications -- notably those that maintain significant server-side state or use
their server to interact within external systems -- should take care to ensure the app is safe to
run in multi-instance mode. Distributed data structures (e.g. Hazelcast Maps) should be used as
needed, as well as limiting certain actions to the "primary" server.

Please contact XH to review your app's readiness for multi-instance operation!

#### Other new features

* New support for reporting service statistics for troubleshooting/monitoring. Implement
  `BaseService.getAdminStats()` to provide diagnostic metadata about the state of your service.
  Output (in JSON format) can be easily viewed in the Hoist Admin Console.
* New `DefaultMonitorDefinitionService` provides default implementations of several new status
  monitors to track core app health metrics. Extend this new superclass in your
  app's `MonitorDefinitionService` to enable support for these new monitors.
* Includes new support for dynamic configuration of client-side authentication libraries. See new
  method `Authentication.getClientConfig()`.

### üí• Breaking Changes (upgrade difficulty: üü† MEDIUM / üü¢ LOW for apps with minimal custom server-side functionality)

* Requires `hoist-react >= 64.0` for essential Admin Console upgrades.
* Requires updated `gradle.properties` to specify `hazelcast.version=5.3.x`. Check hoist-core or
  Toolbox at time of upgrade to confirm exact recommended version.
* Requires column additions to three `xh_` tables with the following SQL or equivalent:
    ```sql
        ALTER TABLE `xh_client_error` ADD COLUMN `instance` VARCHAR(50) NULL;
        ALTER TABLE `xh_track_log` ADD COLUMN `instance` VARCHAR(50) NULL;
        ALTER TABLE `xh_monitor` ADD COLUMN `primary_only` BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
    ```

  On MSSQL, the last column can be added with:
    ```sql
        ALTER TABLE xh_monitor ADD COLUMN primary_only BIT DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL;
    ```
* Apps can configure their HZ cluster by defining a `ClusterConfig` class:
    * This should extend `io.xh.hoist.ClusterConfig` and be within your primary application
      package (`xhAppPackage` in `gradle.properties` - e.g. `io.xh.toolbox.ClusterConfig`).
    * We recommend placing it under `/grails-app/init/` - see Toolbox for an example.
    * Note XH clients with enterprise ("mycompany-hoist") plugins may have their own superclass
      which should be extended instead to provide appropriate defaults for their environment. Note
      that an app-level class is *required* in this case to pick up those defaults, although it will
      commonly not require any additional app-level overrides.
* Apps that intend to run with more than one server *must* enable sticky sessions when routing
  clients to servers. This is critical for the correct operation of authentication and websocket
  communications. Check with XH or your networking team to ensure this is correctly configured.
* Server-side events raised by Hoist are now implemented as cluster-wide Hazelcast messages rather
  than single-server Grails events. Any app code that listens to these events
  via `BaseService.subscribe` must update to `BaseService.subscribeToTopic`. Check for:
    * `xhClientErrorReceived`
    * `xhConfigChanged`
    * `xhFeedbackReceived`
    * `xhMonitorStatusReport`
* The `exceptionRenderer` singleton has been simplified and renamed as `xhExceptionHandler`. This
  change was needed to better support cross-cluster exception handling. This object is used by
  Hoist internally for catching uncaught exceptions and this change is not expected to impact
  most applications.
* `Utils.dataSource` now returns a reference to the actual `javax.sql.DataSource.DataSource`.
  Use `Utils.dataSourceConfig` to access the previous return of this method (DS config, as a map).
* Apps must replace the `buildProperties.doLast` block at the bottom of their `build.gradle` with:
  ```groovy
  tasks.war.doFirst {
     File infoFile = layout.buildDirectory.file('resources/main/META-INF/grails.build.info').get().asFile
     Properties properties = new Properties()
     infoFile.withInputStream {properties.load(it)}
     properties.putAll(hoistMetaData)
     infoFile.withOutputStream {properties.store(it, null)}
  }
  ```

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Calls to URLs with the correct controller but a non-existent action were incorrectly returning
  raw `500` errors. They now return a properly JSON-formatted `404` error, as expected.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* All `Throwable`s are now serialized to JSON using Hoist's standard customization of Jackson.

### üìö Libraries

Please ensure you review and update your `gradle.properties` and `gradle-wrapper.properties` files.

In `gradle.properties` (partial contents of this file, with updated libraries only):

```properties
groovyVersion=3.0.21
grailsVersion=6.2.0
grailsGradlePluginVersion=6.2.0
gormVersion=8.1.0
grailsHibernatePluginVersion=8.1.0
hazelcast.version=5.3.7
```

In `/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` (note your app might have an internal artifact repo
in place of services.gradle.org - leave that as-is, updating the version only to 7.6.4):

```properties
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6.4-bin.zip
```

## 19.0.0 - 2024-04-04

### üí• Breaking Changes (upgrade difficulty: üü¢ LOW - latest Hoist React + DB col additions)

* Requires `hoist-react >= 63.0` for client-side changes to accommodate updated `track`
  and `submitError` APIs. See below for database column additions to support the same.
* Implementations of `DefaultRoleService.doLoadUsersForDirectoryGroups` will need to handle a new
  `strictMode` flag provided as a second argument.

### üéÅ New Features

* Client error reports include a new `impersonating` field for additional troubleshooting context.
    * ‚ö† NOTE - this requires a new column in the `xh_client_error` table. Review and run the
      following SQL, or an equivalent suitable for the particular database you are using:
      ```sql
      ALTER TABLE `xh_client_error` ADD COLUMN `impersonating` VARCHAR(50) NULL;
      ```
* Activity tracking logs include new `appVersion`, `appEnvironment` and `url` fields.
    * ‚ö† NOTE - this requires new columns in the `xh_track_log` table. Review and run the following
      SQL, or an equivalent suitable for the particular database you are using:
      ```sql
      ALTER TABLE `xh_track_log` ADD COLUMN `app_version` VARCHAR(100) NULL;
      ALTER TABLE `xh_track_log` ADD COLUMN `app_environment` VARCHAR(100) NULL;
      ALTER TABLE `xh_track_log` ADD COLUMN `url` VARCHAR(500) NULL;
      ```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* `DefaultRoleService` has improved error handling for failed directory group lookups.
* `LdapService` bulk lookup methods now provide a `strict` option to throw if a query fails rather
  than quietly returning an empty result.
* New `TrackLogAdminService` and `ClientErrorAdminService` services provide improved APIs for
  querying `TrackLog` and `ClientError` records. Leveraged by updated Hoist Admin Console to post
  selected filters to the server and return more relevant data within configured row limits.

## 18.5.2 - 2024-04-03

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Fixed bug in `DefaultRoleService.doLoadUsersForDirectoryGroups` where LDAP members with `null`
  samAccountNames were not being filtered out, causing `NullPointerExceptions`.

## 18.5.1 - 2024-03-08

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Quiet log warnings from `LdapNetworkConnection` in `LdapService` by setting
  the `LdapNetworkConnection` log level to `ERROR`.

## 18.5.0 - 2024-03-08

### üí• Breaking Changes (upgrade difficulty: üü¢ TRIVIAL)

* Method `DefaultRoleService.ensureUserHasRoles` has been renamed to `assignRole`.
  The new name more clearly describes that the code will actually grant an additional
  role to the user.

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Fixed `LdapService` bug where querying multiple servers with same host yielded incomplete results.

## 18.4.0 - 2024-02-13

### üéÅ New Features

* `InstanceConfigUtils` - used to read low-level configuration values such as database credentials -
  will now search for an environment variable with a matching name and return that value if it
  exists.
    * This can either override or entirely replace the use of a yaml file or Kubernetes secrets to
      specify this kind of configuration.
    * To help namespace app-specific environment variables while also maintaining the conventions of
      instance configs having `camelCase` identifiers and environment variables
      having `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` identifiers, `InstanceConfigUtils` will convert and
      prepend `APP_[APP_CODE]_` to the requested key when looking for an environment variable. For
      example, in our Toolbox demo app `InstanceConfigUtils.getInstanceConfig('dbUrl')` will check
      if an environment variable named `APP_TOOLBOX_DB_URL` exists, and return its value if so.
* `ConfigService` methods now return override values from an instance config, if one exists with
  the same name as an app config.
    * Allows an instance-specific value specified via a yaml file or environment variable to
      override the config value saved to the app's database, including configs used by Hoist itself.
    * Update to `hoist-react >= 60.2` for an Admin Console upgrade that checks for and clearly
      indicates any overridden values in the Config editor tab.
* `EnvAdminController` now obfuscates environment variables ending with `password` and similarly
  sensitive strings.

## 18.3.2 - 2024-02-01

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Fixed bug in `LdapService.lookupUser` where queries were not being formed correctly.

## 18.3.1 - 2024-01-30

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Fixed bug in `DefaultRoleService` where not all effective roles were being returned for a user.

## 18.3.0 - 2024-01-29

### üéÅ New Features

* `DefaultRoleService` now includes support for out-of-the-box LDAP groups.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Refactor `DefaultRoleService` for more efficient and straightforward role/user resolution
* Normalize role member usernames to lowercase and generally tighten up case-insensitive handling.

## 18.2.1 - 2024-01-25

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Fixed `DefaultRoleService` unintended case-sensitive handling of usernames.

## 18.2.0 - 2024-01-24

### üéÅ New Features

* Added new `LdapService` to provide out-of-the-box support for querying LDAP groups and users via
  the [Apache Directory](https://directory.apache.org/) library.
* √Ödded `ConfigService.hasConfig()` method to check if a config exists.

## 18.1.0 - 2024-01-18

### üéÅ New Features

* Improved handling of requests during application initialization. HTTP requests received
  during App startup will now yield clean "App Initializing" Exceptions. This is an improvement over
  the current behavior where attempting to service requests prematurely can cause arbitrary and
  misleading exceptions.

* Misc. Improvements to `DefaultRoleService` API and documentation.

## 18.0.1 - 2024-01-16

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue preventing the creation of new roles.

## 18.0.0 - 2024-01-12

### üéÅ New Features

* New support for Role Management.
    * Hoist now supports an out-of-the-box, database-driven system for maintaining a hierarchical
      set of roles and associating them with individual users.
    * New system supports app and plug-in specific integrations to AD and other enterprise systems.
    * Hoist-react `v60` is now required and will provide an administrative UI to visualize and
      manage the new role system.
    * See `DefaultRoleService` for more information.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Add `xh/echoHeaders` utility endpoint. Useful for verifying headers (e.g. `jespa_connection_id`)
  that are installed by or must pass through multiple ingresses/load balancers.
* Remove HTML tag escaping when parsing alert banner create/update request JSON.

### üí• Breaking Changes

* Applications will typically need to adjust their implementation of `BaseRoleService`. Most
  applications are expected to adopt the new provided `DefaultRoleService`, and may be required to
  migrate existing code/data to the new API. Applications that wish to continue to use a completely
  custom `BaseRoleService` will need to implement one additional method: `getUsersForRole`.

## 17.4.0 - 2023-11-09

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Improvement to `BaseProxyService` to better handle exceptions during streaming.
* Optimization to `WebSocketService` to remove an extra layer of async task wrapping when pushing to
  a single channel.

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Workaround for GORM issue with unconstrained findAll() and list() breaking eager fetching.
  See https://github.com/grails/gorm-hibernate5/issues/750.

## 17.3.0 - 2023-09-18

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* New `ConfigService.setValue()` API supports programmatic updates to existing app configs.

## 17.2.0 - 2023-08-17

### üéÅ New Features

* Lightweight monitoring collection of JDBC connection pool statistics, including counters for
  active vs idle connections. Viewable in Hoist Admin Console for apps on `hoist-react >= 59.0`.

## 17.1.0 - 2023-08-08

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Additional improvements to support hot-reloading.

## 17.0.0 - 2023-07-27

This release upgrades Hoist to the latest 6.0.0 version of Grails and upgrades related libraries.
It should be fully compatible with Java 11 and Java 17.

### üéÅ New Features

* This version of Hoist restores the ability to do development-time reloading via the java hotswap
  agent. [See the readme](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/blob/develop/README.md#hot-reloading) for
  more information.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* The implementation of the `LogSupport` trait has been simplified, such that it no longer requires
  an @SLF4J annotation, or `log` property to be provided. Undocumented and problematic methods
  `logXXXInBase` were removed.

### üìö Libraries

* grails `5.3.2 ‚Üí 6.0.0`
* gorm `7.3.2` ‚Üí `8.0.0`
* groovy `3.0.9` ‚Üí `3.0.11`

## 16.4.4 - 2023-08-03

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Replace bullet points with hyphens in default `xhAppVersionCheck` config.

## 16.4.3 - 2023-08-02

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Remove one remaining smart quote to make default notes in default config safer for all DBs.

## 16.4.2 - 2023-07-31

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Make default notes in default config safer for all DBs by removing smart quotes.

## 16.4.1 - 2023-07-13

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Make impersonation service more robust for applications with dynamic/lazy user generation.
* Additional validation of parameters to '/userAdmin/users' endpoint.

## 16.4.0 - 2023-07-07

### üéÅ New Features

* Added new `logData` option to `TrackService.track()` - allows applications to request that
  key/value pairs provided within the `data` block of a track statement be logged along with the
  standard output. Client-side support for this feature on a per-call basis added
  in `hoist-react >= 57.1`, can also be defaulted within the `xhActivityTrackingConfig` app config.
* Deprecated config `xhAppVersionCheckEnabled` in favor of object based `xhAppVersionCheck`. Apps
  will migrate the existing value to this new config's `mode` flag. This supports the new
  `forceRefresh` mode introduced in hoist-react v58.

## 16.3.0 - 2023-06-20

### üéÅ New Features

* Added support for saving alert banner presets (requires `hoist-react >= 57.0.0` to use this new
  functionality, but backwards compatible with earlier hoist-react releases).
* Defined new `HOIST_IMPERSONATOR` role to control access to Hoist's user-impersonation feature.
    * This new role is inherited by `HOIST_ADMIN` (the role previously required) by default,
      although applications can override `BaseUserService.getRolesForUser()` to customize.
    * Applications that have already overridden this method will need to re-implement this role
      inheritance, or assign the new role to appropriate users directly.
* Exposed new `BaseUserService.impersonationTargetsForUser()` template method to allow apps to
  customize the list of users that an admin can impersonate.
* Added support for OWASP-encoding user submitted strings to `BaseController` via a
  new `safeEncode()` method and a new `safeEncode` option to `parseRequestJSON()`
  and `parseRequestJSONArray()`.
    * Apps are encouraged to run any user-provided inputs through this method to prevent XSS
      attacks.

## 16.2.0 - 2023-05-26

### üéÅ New Features

* Added new `BaseController` methods `parseRequestJSON()` and `parseRequestJSONArray()`.
    * These methods are the recommended way to parse JSON from a request body - they will use
      Hoist's optimized, Jackson-based `JSONParser`.
* Created new `xhExpectedServerTimeZone` app config, now read at startup to validate that the server
  is running in a particular, application-configured time zone.
    * Default value of `*` will skip validation but log a warning that no zone is configured.
    * If a zone is configured, Hoist will throw a fatal exception if it does not match the zone
      reported by Java.
    * Most applications should ensure that this config and the runtime JVM are set to the same time
      zone as their primary database.
* Added `h2Config` method to `RuntimeConfig` class to give apps the option of starting up with an H2
  in-memory DB. This is intended for projects in their earliest, "just checked out, first run"
  stage, when a developer wants to get started before having set up an external database.
* Updated `AlertBannerService` to append the environment name when creating/updating the `JsonBlob`
  used to persist banner state in a non-production environment. This better supports apps where
  e.g. `Beta` and `Production` environments share a database, but should display distinct banners.
* Added support for the `caseSensitive` flag in log filtering endpoint.

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Fixed a regression preventing the culling of snapshots in the memory monitoring service.

## 16.1.0 - 2023-04-14

* Enhance MemoryMonitoringService.
    * Produce and use more appropriate usage metric (used/max)
    * Produce GC statistics
    * Support for taking a heap dump

## 16.0.1 - 2023-03-29

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Fixed a regression with 404 errors being incorrectly handled and not serialized as JSON.

## 16.0.0 - 2023-03-24

### üéÅ New Features

* `EmailService.sendEmail()` now supports the `attachments` argument, for attaching one or more
  files to the email.
* A new `xhActivityTrackingConfig` soft-configuration entry will be automatically created to control
  the behavior of built-in Activity Tracking (via `TrackService`).
    * Most notably, the size of any `data` objects included with track log entries will be
      constrained by this config, primarily to constrain memory usage when querying and serializing
      large numbers of log entries for the Admin Console.
    * Any track requests with data objects exceeding this length will be persisted, but without the
      requested data.

### üí• Breaking Changes

* Removed support for "local" preferences - any existing prefs previously marked as local will now
  work like all others, with their values persisted on the server.
    * Apps upgrading to this Core release should simultaneously upgrade to Hoist React v56, which
      will automatically post any existing local preference *values* to the server.
    * Alternatively, update client-side code to use browser local storage for persisting user state
      that should remain tightly bound to a particular computer.
    * Update the schema to set `xh_preference` table's `local` column to allow nulls. If this is
      not done, a Hibernate error (`local` column cannot be null) will be thrown when an admin
      tries to add a new preference to the app.
        ```sql
        alter table xh_preference alter column local bit null
        ```
    * Once they are sure no rollback is needed, apps can safely delete the `xh_preference` table's
      `local` column.
      ```sql
      alter table xh_preference drop column local
      ```

* Grails has been updated to `5.3.2`. While this change did not itself introduce any breaking
  changes, applications should update their Grails version within `gradle.properties` to match.

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Client Error timestamps will now correctly reflect the exact time the error was received on the
  server rather than the time the error was bulk processed by the server.

### üìö Libraries

* grails `5.2.1 ‚Üí 5.3.2`

## 15.0.0 - 2022-12-5

### üéÅ New Features

Version 15 includes changes to support more flexible logging of structured data:

* The bulk of Hoist conventions around log formatting have been moved from `LogSupport` to a new
  log converter -- `LogSupportConverter`. This allows applications to more easily and fully
  customize their log formats by specifying custom converters.
* `LogSupport` should still be the main entry point for most application logging. This class
  provides the support for enhanced meta data-handling as well as some important APIs -
  e.g. `withDebug()` and `withInfo()`.
* Applications are now encouraged to provide `LogSupport` methods with data in `Map` form. Provided
  converters will serialize these maps as appropriate for target logs.
* Hoist's `LogSupportConverter` is intended for easy reading by humans, allows specifying
  keys that should disappear in the final output with an `_` prefix. This is useful for keys that
  are obvious, e.g. `[_status: 'completed', rows: 100]` logs as `'completed' | rows=100`.
* Alternatively, applications may now specify custom converters that preserve all keys and are
  more appropriate for automatic processing (e.g. splunk). An example of such a converter is
  `CustomLogSupportConverter` which can be found in
  the [Toolbox project](https://github.com/xh/toolbox).
* By default, Hoist now also logs the time in millis when a log message occurred.

## 14.4.2 - 2022-11-14

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Improved the signatures of `LogSupport` methods `withInfo` (and similar) to pass through the
  return type of their closure argument.

## 14.4.1 - 2022-10-24

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Allow database connection info to viewed by users with role: `HOIST_ADMIN_READER` and higher.

## 14.4.0 - 2022-10-19

### üéÅ New Features

* The Hoist Admin Console is now accessible in a read-only capacity to users assigned the
  new `HOIST_ADMIN_READER` role.
* The pre-existing `HOIST_ADMIN` role inherits this new role, and is still required to take any
  actions that modify data.
* Requires `hoist-react >= 53.0` for client-side support of this new readonly role.

## 14.3.1 - 2022-10-10

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Status monitor now prepends its generated message to any more specific message provided by
  app-level status check code when the result is ERROR, FAIL, or WARN. Previously any app-specific
  messages were overridden entirely.

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Correct type specified for `notFoundValue` arg in `ConfigService.getLong()` and `getDouble()`
  method signatures.

## 14.3.0 - 2022-09-23

* Excel exports now support per-cell data types and long values for `int` types.

## 14.2.1 - 2022-09-06

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Fix to minor regression in client error emails.

## 14.2.0 - 2022-08-19

* Activity tracking enhancements. Tracking can now be done without the context of a web request and
  an explicit specification of a username is allowed.

## 14.1.2 - 2022-08-05

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Relaxed character limit on subject length for emails sent via `emailService` from `70` to `255`

## 14.1.1 - 2022-08-03

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Revert groovy version to `3.0.9` to support java/groovy compilation.

### üìö Libraries

* groovy `3.0.11 ‚Üí 3.0.9`

## 14.1.0 - 2022-07-29

‚ö† Note - applications should add `logback.version=1.2.7` as a new line to their `gradle.properties`
file to fix logback on a version that remains compatible with Hoist's Groovy-based configuration.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* `PrefService.getClientConfig()` has been optimized to reduce the number of database calls.
  Previously one select was issued per non-local preference when the second-level query cache was
  cold for a given user. Now only a single select is required.
* `DateTimeUtils` app/server timezone conversion utils default to current day/date if called without
  arguments.
* Standard JSON serialization/deserialization of newer Java date classes added with registration of
  the JSR310 module.
* `LogSupport` methods `withInfo`, `withDebug`, and  `withTrace` will now output a pre-work "
  Starting" message whenever logging is at level 'debug' or above. Previously level 'trace' was
  required.
* Additional logging added to `MemoryMonitoringService`.

### üìö Libraries

* grails `5.1.1 ‚Üí 5.2.1`
* groovy `3.0.9 ‚Üí 3.0.11`
* gorm `7.1.2 ‚Üí 7.3.2`

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/compare/v13.0.6...v13.1.0)

## 13.0.6 - 2022-01-13

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* `LocalDate`s are now serialized in the more fully ISO standard "YYYY-MM-DD" format, rather than
  "YYYYMMDD". Note that this is consistent with similar changes to `LocalDate` serialization in
  Hoist React v46.
* Although this format will be accepted client-side by `hoist-react >= 45.0`, apps that are parsing
  these strings directly on the client may need to be updated accordingly.

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Fix to Regressions in JsonBlobService/AlertBannerService

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/compare/v13.0.5...v13.0.6)

## 13.0.5 - 2022-01-11

This version includes a major upgrade of several underlying libraries, especially grails (5.1),
spring (5.3), spring-boot (2.6), groovy (3.0), and gradle (7.3). With this version, Hoist can now be
run on Java versions 11 - 17. We have also cleaned up and enhanced some core APIs around Exception
Handling, JSON parsing and configuration.

Please see
the [Grails5 Toolbox update commit](https://github.com/xh/toolbox/commit/2e75cb44f5c600384334406724bb63e3abc98dcc)
for the application-level changes to core configuration files and dependencies.

### üí• Breaking Changes

* The trait `AsyncSupport` with its single method `asyncTask` has been removed. Use the equivalent
  method `task` from `grails.async.Promises` instead.
* The method `subscribeWithSession` on `BaseService` has been removed. Use `subscribe` instead.
* Application Tomcat Dockerfiles must be updated to use a new `xh-tomcat` base image on JDK 11/17.
* Groovy Language:  `list` methods changed:
    * `push()` now prepends an item to the start of the List. To append to the end, use `add()`.
    * `pop()` now removes the first item from the List. To remove the last item, use `removeLast()`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* This release upgrades the major version of grails from 3.3.9 to 5.1. This major release includes
  the following upgrades of related libraries:
    * spring boot `1.x ‚Üí 2.6`
    * groovy `2.4 ‚Üí 3.0`
    * gradle `4.10 ‚Üí 7.3`
    * gorm `6.1 ‚Üí 7.1`
    * hibernate `5.1 ‚Üí 5.6`
    * org.grails.plugins:mail `2.0 ‚Üí 3.0`
    * apache poi  `3.1` ‚Üí `4.1`
* Default application configuration is now better bundled within hoist-core. See new
  classes `ApplicationConfig`, `LogbackConfig`, and `RuntimeConfig`. Please consult the grails docs
  as well as the Toolbox update linked above for more information on required changes to config and
  dependency files.
* Options for hot reloading have changed, as `spring-loaded` is now longer supported for java
  versions > jdk 8. As such, options for hot reloading of individual classes are more limited, and
  may require additional tools such as JRebel. See the grails upgrade guide for more info.
* Applications will be required to add the `@Transactional` or `@ReadOnly` annotations to service
  and controller methods that update data or read data from Hibernate/GORM.
* HttpClient has been upgraded from `4.5 ‚Üí 5.1`. Package names have changed, and applications using
  this API (e.g. with `JSONClient`) will need to update their imports statements to reflect the new
  locations @ `org.apache.hc.client5.http` and `org.apache.hc.core5.http`. See Toolbox for examples.
* WebSocket Support has been simplified. To enable WebSockets, simply set the application config
  `hoist.enableWebSockets = true` in `application.groovy`. This can replace the custom annotation /
  enhancement of the Application class used in earlier versions of Hoist.
* Hoist JSON Validation now uses the same Jackson configuration used by `JSONParser`.
* The optional `withHibernate` argument to `Timer` is obsolete and no longer needed.

* Minor tweak to allow nested lists and arrays in `LogSupport` statements. Improved documentation.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/compare/v11.0.1...v11.0.2)

## 11.0.1 - 2021-12-03

### üéÅ New Features

* Enhancement to `LogSupport` to help standardize logging across all Service and Controllers. New
  methods `logInfo`, `logDebug`, `logTrace`, `logWarn`, and `logError` now provide consistent
  formatting of log messages plus log-level aware output of any throwables passed to these methods.
  See LogSupport for more info.

### üí• Breaking Changes

* The methods `LogSupport.logErrorCompact` and `LogSupport.logDebugCompact` have been removed. Use
  `logError` and `logDebug` instead, passing your `Throwable` as the last argument to these methods.

### üêû Bug Fixes

* The `lastUpdatedBy` column found in various Admin grid now tracks the authenticated user's
  username, indicating if an update was made while impersonating a user.
* Fix to bug causing 'Edge' browser to be incorrectly identified.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/compare/v10.1.0...v11.0.1)

## 10.1.0 - 2021-11-03

### üéÅ New Features

* New Admin endpoint to output environment variables and JVM system properties.
    * Take (optional) update to `hoist-react >= 44.1.0` for corresponding Hoist Admin Console UI.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/compare/v10.0.0...v10.1.0)

## 10.0.0 - 2021-10-26

‚ö† NOTE - apps *must* update to `hoist-react >= 44.0.0` when taking this hoist-core update.

### üéÅ New Features

* Log Levels now include information on when the custom config was last updated and by whom. Note
  required database modifications in Breaking Changes below.
* Client Error messages are now saved and sent in bulk on a timer. This allows Hoist to bundle
  multiple error reports into a single alert email and generally improves how a potential storm of
  error reports is handled.
* Improved `JsonBlob` editing now supports setting null values for relevant fields.

### üí• Breaking Changes

* Update required to `hoist-react >= 44.0.0` due to changes in `JsonBlobService` APIs and the
  addition of new, dedicated endpoints for Alert Banner management.
* Public methods on `JsonBlobService` have been updated - input parameters have changed in some
  cases, and they now return `JsonBlob` instances (instead of pre-formatted Maps).
* Two new columns should be added to the `xh_log_level` table in your app's database: a datetime
  column and a nullable varchar(50) column. Review and run the SQL below, or an equivalent suitable
  for your app's database. (Note that both columns are marked as nullable to allow the schema change
  to be applied to a database in advance of the upgraded deployment.)

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE `xh_log_level` ADD `last_updated` DATETIME NULL;
  ALTER TABLE `xh_log_level` ADD`last_updated_by` VARCHAR(50) NULL;
  ```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Dedicated admin endpoints added for Alert Banner management, backed by a new `AlertBannerService`.

* Applications will no longer default to "development" environment in server deployments. A
  recognized environment must be explicitly provided.

## 9.3.2 - 2021-10-01

* `EmailService` now requires an override or filter config before sending any mails in local
  development mode.
* `ClientErrorEmailService` now relays any client URL captured with the error.

## 9.3.0 - 2021-08-11

### üéÅ New Features

* Excel cell styles with grouped colors are now cached for re-use, avoiding previously common file
  error that limits Excel tables to 64,000 total styles.
* Client error reports now include the full URL for additional troubleshooting context.
    * ‚ö† NOTE - this requires a new, nullable varchar(500) column be added to the xh_client_error
      table in your app's configuration database. Review and run the following SQL, or an equivalent
      suitable for the particular database you are using:

      ```sql
      ALTER TABLE `xh_client_error` ADD COLUMN `url` VARCHAR(500) NULL;
      ```

## 9.2.1 - 2021-04-14

### üêû Bug Fixes

* `GridExportImplService` now handles Excel table exports containing no data rows. Previously, the
  Excel file required repair, during which all table and column header formatting was lost.
* Status Monitors no longer evaluate metric-based thresholds if an app-level check implementation
  has already set marked the result with a `FAIL` or `INACTIVE` status, allowing an app to fail or
  dynamically disable a check regardless of its metric.
* Fix incorrect formatting pattern strings on `DateTimeUtils`.

## 9.2.0 - 2021-03-25

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Restore JSON Serialization of `NaN` and `Infinity` as `null`. This had long been the standard
  Hoist JSON serialization for `Double`s and `Float`s but was regressed in v7.0 with the move to
  Jackson-based JSON serialization.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/compare/v9.1.0...v9.1.1)

## 9.1.0 - 2020-12-22

### üéÅ New Features

* Built-in logging utils `withDebug`, `withInfo`, `compactErrorLog` and `compactDebugLog` will log
  username when called in the context of a user request.
* New method `IdentityService.getUsername()` for efficient access to username when no additional
  details about current user are needed.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Improve consistency of exception descriptions in logs.
* Remove repeated exception descriptions in logs: `withDebug` and `withInfo` will no longer print
  exception details.
* TrackService will now log to a dedicated daily log file.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/compare/v9.0.0...v9.1.0)

## 9.0.0 - 2020-12-17

### üí• Breaking Changes

* `LogSupport` API enhancements:
    * `logErrorCompact()` and `logDebugCompact()` now only show stacktraces on `TRACE`
    * `withInfo()` and `withDebug()` now log only once _after_ execution has completed. Raising the
      log level of the relevant class or package to `TRACE` will cause these utils to also log a
      line
      _before_ execution, as they did before. (As always, log levels can be adjusted dynamically at
      runtime via the Admin Console.)
    * The upgrade to these two utils mean that they **completely replace** `withShortInfo()` and
      `withShortDebug()`, which have both been **removed** as part of this change.
    * Additional stacktraces have been removed from default logging.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* `RoutineException`s are now returned with HttpStatus `400` to client, rather than `500`

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/compare/v8.7.3...v9.0.0)

## 8.7.3 - 2020-12-15

* Default exception logging in `ExceptionRender` will no longer include stacktraces, but will
  instead use `LogSupport.logErrorCompact()`. To see stacktraces for any given logger, set the
  logging level to `DEBUG`.

## 8.7.0 - 2020-12-01

### üéÅ New Features

* Added new `MemoryMonitoringService` to sample and return simple statistics on heap (memory) usage
  from the JVM runtime. Stores a rolling, in-memory history of snapshots on a configurable interval.

### üîí Security

* HTML-encode certain user-provided params to XhController endpoints (e.g. track, clientErrors,
  feedback) to sanitize before storing / emailing.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Removed verbose stacktraces appended to the primary app log by the built-in Grails 'StackTrace'
  logger. This logger has now been set to level *OFF* by default. To re-enable these stacktraces,
  raise the log level of this logger in either logback.groovy or dynamically at runtime in the Hoist
  Admin Console.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/compare/v8.6.1...v8.7.0)

## 8.6.1 - 2020-10-28

* `JsonBlobService` - complete support for metadata with additional `meta` property. Requires an
  additional column on blob table, e.g:

  ```sql
  alter table xh_json_blob add meta varchar(max) go
  ```
* Introduce new `AppEnvironment.TEST` enumeration value.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/compare/v8.6.0...v8.6.1)

## 8.6.0 - 2020-10-25

* `JsonBlobService`: Enhancements to archiving, new columns and new unique key constraint.
    - Apps will need to modify the `xh_json_blob` table with new `archived_date` column and related
      unique constraint. SAMPLE migration SQL below:

      ```sql
      alter table xh_json_blob add archived_date bigint not null go
      alter table xh_json_blob drop column archived go
      alter table xh_json_blob add constraint idx_xh_json_blob_unique_key unique (archived_date, type, owner, name)
      ```

    - Apps should update to `hoist-react >= 36.6.0`.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/compare/v8.5.0...v8.6.0)

## 8.5.0 - 2020-10-07

* `JsonBlobService`: Use more scalable token-based access; support archiving. Requires additional
  columns on blob table, e.g:

  ```sql
  alter table xh_json_blob add token varchar(255) not null go
  alter table xh_json_blob add archived boolean default false go
  ```

  Note that the `archived` column is dropped in subsequent versions, and thus need not be added
  unless you are using 8.5.0 specifically.

## 8.3.0 - 2020-09-21

‚ö† NOTE - apps should update to `hoist-react >= 36.1.0` when taking this hoist-core update. This is
required to support the updates to Admin Activity and Client Error tracking described below.

### üéÅ New Features

* Adds support for storing and retrieving `JsonBlob`s - chunks of arbitrary JSON data used by the
  corresponding `JsonBlobService` introduced in hoist-react v36.1.0.

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Improved time zone handling in the Admin Console "Activity Tracking" and "Client Errors" tabs.
    * Users will now see consistent bucketing of activity into an "App Day" that corresponds to the
      LocalDate when the event occurred in the application's timezone.
    * This day will be reported consistently regardless of the time zones of the local browser or
      deployment server.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Licensing Change

As of this release, Hoist is [now licensed](LICENSE.md) under the popular and permissive
[Apache 2.0 open source license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). Previously, Hoist was
"source available" via our public GitHub repository but still covered by a proprietary license.

We are making this change to align Hoist's licensing with our ongoing commitment to openness,
transparency and ease-of-use, and to clarify and emphasize the suitability of Hoist for use within a
wide variety of enterprise software projects. For any questions regarding this change, please
[contact us](https://xh.io/).

### üéÅ New Features

* New support for `appTimeZone` and `serverTimeZone` in `EnvironmentService`.
* New support for eliding long strings: `StringUtils.elide()`.
* New support for the enhanced Admin Activity Tracking tab shipping in hoist-react v35.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/compare/v7.0.0...v7.0.1)

## 7.0.0 - 2020-05-08

### üéÅ New Features

* Exception Handling has been improved in the newly enhanced `exceptionRenderer` bean. This bean
  will catch uncaught exceptions from all Controllers and Timers and has been newly configured to
  limit the logging of unnecessary stack traces.

* New exception classes for `HttpException` and `ExternalHttpException` have been added.

* JSON parsing in Hoist has been reworked to simplify and standardize based on the high-performance
  Jackson library. (https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson). Benchmarking shows a speedup in parsing
  times of 10x to 20x over the `grails.converter.JSON` library currently used by Hoist. In
  particular, this change includes:
    * A new `JSONParser` API in the `io.xh.hoist.json` package that provides JSON parsing of text
      and input streams. This API is designed to be symmetrical with the existing `JSONFormatter.`
    * All core hoist classes now rely on the API above. Of special note are `JSONClient`, and
      `RestController`.
    * Cleanups to the APIs for `JSONClient`, `ConfigService`, and `PrefService`. These methods now
      return java object representations using the standard java `Map` and `List` interfaces rather
      than the confusing `JSONObject`, `JSONArray` and `JSONElement` objects.

### üéÅ Breaking Changes

* The `getJSONObject()`, `getJSONArray()`, and `getJSON()` methods on `ConfigService` and
  `PrefService` have been replaced with `getMap()` and `getList()`.
* The `executeAsJSONObject()` and `executeAsJSONArray()` methods on `JSONClient` have been replaced
  with `executeAsMap()` and `executeAsList()`.
* The method `RestController.preprocessSubmit()` now takes a `Map` as its single input, rather than
  a `JSONObject`.

## 6.7.0 - 2020-04-22

### üí• Breaking Changes

* `Timer.delay` now expects either a millisecond value, or a boolean. It no longer will take a
  string/closure and `Timer.delayUnits` has been removed. This has been changed to enhance the
  functionality and make it consistent with its client-side counterpart in hoist-react.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/compare/v6.6.0...v6.7.0)

## 6.6.0 - 2020-03-27

### üéÅ New Features

* New `xhEnableLogViewer` config available to fully disable the log viewer built into the Admin
  console. Intended for scenarios where the UI server logs are not material/helpful, or potentially
  for cases where they are too chatty/large to be effectively viewed in the Admin UI.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/compare/v6.5.0...v6.6.0)

## 6.5.0 - 2020-03-16

### üéÅ New Features

* Added support for setting custom logging layouts. Applications can use this to further customize
  built-in Hoist logging, including changing it to use alternative file formats such as JSON.
* Also includes enhanced documentation and an example of how to configure logging in Hoist.

## 6.4.4 - 2020-03-05

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Fixed issue where attempting to read very large log files would overly stress server processor and
  memory resources. [#115](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/issues/115)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Add ability to configure WebSocketService resource limits using soft configuration.
* Note intermediate builds 6.4.2/6.4.3 not for use.

## 6.4.1 - 2020-02-29

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where GORM validation exceptions would trigger MethodNotFoundException

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* Switch to using [nanoJson](https://github.com/mmastrac/nanojson) for JSON validation, which
  ensures stricter adherence to the JSON spec.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/compare/v6.4.0...v6.4.1)

## 6.4.0 - 2020-01-21

### üéÅ New Features

* Added a new `xhEnableImpersonation` config for enabling or disabling impersonation app-wide. Note
  that this config will be defaulted to false if not yet defined - set to true after upgrade to
  continue supporting impersonation for your application.
* The `xhMonitorConfig` config supports a new property `monitorTimeoutSecs` to control the max
  runtime for any individual monitor check.
* Any `appBuild` tag is now included in the output of `xh/version`, allowing for client-side version
  checking to take the particular build into account when running on a SNAPSHOT.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* All exceptions are now rendered as JSON. HTML exception rendering is no longer supported.
* Exceptions in GORM validation will now be treated as routine and will not be logged.
  ([#95](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/issues/95))
* GORM validation exceptions are now handled by `BaseController` rather than `RestController`, so
  all endpoints will be handled consistently. ([#68](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/issues/68))

### üêû Bug Fixes

* JSON preferences accept any valid `JSONElement` for their value, not just a `JSONObject`.
* Default `TrackLog.severity` to `INFO` vs. non-standard `OK`.
* Bootstrapped `xhEmailSupport` config now properly `clientVisible`.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/compare/v6.3.0...v6.3.1)

## 6.3.0 - 2019-09-04

### üéÅ New Features

* Grid exports to Excel now support setting an export format on a per-cell basis. Requires an
  updated Hoist React build for client-side support, but is backwards compatible with existing API.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical

* `JSONClient` can be constructed without providing a configured `ClosableHttpClient`. A default
  client will be created and used.
* When pointed to a directory, `InstanceConfigUtils` will first check to see if it contains a file
  named `[appCode].yml` and, if so, will load configs from that single file and return. Otherwise,
  individual files within that directory will be loaded as key/value pairs, as they were previously.
  This allows a single `-Dio.xh.hoist.instanceConfigFile` value to be baked into a container build
  and resolve to either single-file or directory-mode configs based on the deployment environment.

## 6.1.0 - 2019-07-31

### üéÅ New Features

* **WebSocket support** has been added in the form of `WebSocketService`. The new service maintains
  and provides send/receive functionality to connected Hoist client apps, each associated with a
  unique channel identifier.
    * ‚ö† **Note** this change requires that applications specify a new dependency in their
      `build.gradle` file on `compile "org.springframework:spring-websocket"`. If missing, apps will
      throw an exception on startup related to a failure instantiating `WebSocketService`. Apps
      should
      *not* need to make any changes to their own code / services aside from this new dep.
    * This service and its related endpoints integrate with client-side websocket support and admin
      tools added to Hoist React v26.
    * As per the included class-level documentation, applications must update their
      Application.groovy file to expose an endpoint for connections and wire up
      a `HoistWebSocketHandler` to relay connection events to the new service.

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Dedicated Jackson JSON serializer added for Groovy `GString` objects - outputs `toString()` as
  expected vs. obscure/unwanted object representation (#87).

## 6.0.2 - 2019-07-24

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Grid exports will no longer fail if any values fail to parse as per the specified data type.
  Previously a single unexpected value could spoil the export - now they will be passed through
  as-is to the generated worksheet.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/compare/v6.0.1...v6.0.2)

## 6.0.1 - 2019-07-19

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Ensure JSON is rendered with `charset=UTF-8` vs. an unexpected ISO fallback we started getting
  once we stopped using the built-in Grails JSON converter in favor of rendering the String output
  from Jackson . Fixes issue with unicode characters getting munged in JSON responses.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/compare/v6.0.0...v6.0.1)

## 6.0.0 - 2019-07-10

### üéÅ New Features

* A `RoutineException` interface has been added. Implement this interface to mark any exception that
  is a part of normal operations and should not necessarily be logged on the server as an error.
* The `DataNotAvailableException` has been added. This class implements `RoutineException` and is
  intended to be thrown when requested data is not currently available due to normal, expected
  business conditions (e.g. the business day has just rolled and new data is not yet ready).
* The [Jackson library](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) is now used for JSON Serialization.
  This provides a faster, more standardized approach to rendering JSON. Groovy Traits are also no
  longer used for Hoist's Cached JSON support, improving the ability to use this feature with Java.
* Added `/ping` endpoint for trivial server up / connectivity checks.

### üí• Breaking Changes

* The `cacheJSON()` method on JSONFormat is no longer available for specifying cached JSON
  serialization. Extend the `JSONFormatCached` class instead.

## v5.1.0

### üéÅ New Features

* `InstanceConfigUtils` can now read bootstrap configuration values from a directory of files, each
  containing a single config, in addition to the previous support for yaml files. This supports
  reading low-level configuration from Docker/Kubernetes configs and secrets, which are mounted to
  the container filesystem as a directory.

### üêû Bug Fixes

* An admin client that happens to be polling for a non-existent log file (e.g. one that has just
  been archived) will no longer spam the logs with stack traces.

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/compare/v5.0.4...v5.1.0)

## v5.0.4

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Avoids the use of (sometimes) reserved SQL word `level` in the `LogLevel` config object. Remapped
  to `log_level` column.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note that this will require a schema update if Grails is not configured to do so automatically,
and will result in existing overrides having a null level (which is supported and means "no
override").

[Commit Log](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/compare/release-5.0.3...v5.0.4)

## v5.0.3

### üí• Breaking Changes

**This release includes several core API changes to how users and their roles (permissions) are
loaded.** (Note that the breaking changes below will typically be handled by updates to a custom
enterprise plugin and not require individual app changes.)

* Applications (or enterprise plugins) must implement a new `RoleService` extending from
  `BaseRoleService` to provide a map of users to their app-specific roles. Roles continue to be
  modelled as simple strings for use both on server and client.
* The `HoistUser` superclass no longer holds / caches its roles directly, but instead calls into the
  new required `RoleService` dynamically when asked.
* Boilerplate around auth whitelists and resources has been better consolidated into the plugin,
  helping to clean up some repeated application-level `AuthenticationService` code.
* Hoist implementation endpoints have moved from `/hoistImpl/ ‚Üí /xh/` for brevity / clarity.
  Client-side plugins will be updated to use this new path. The implementation APIs used to
  login/logout and confirm auth / roles have changed, but again are handled by Hoist client plugin
  updates and do not require application-level changes.

## v4.0.0

### üí• Breaking Changes

* Relevant `HoistImplController` endpoints now require a `clientUsername` param to ensure the client
  and server are in sync re. the currently active user. This resolves edge-case bugs around
  impersonation and preference, dashboard changes flushing changes on unload to the wrong
  server-side user. (#46)

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Log archiving fixed for apps with a dash or underscore in their appCode.

## v.3.0.4

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Removed plugin grails-x-frame-options-plugin. It will be put into the hoist-sencha project. It is
  only needed in hoist-sencha apps. Hoist-react apps will get this header set by nginx.

## v.3.0.3

### üéÅ New Features

* Added plugin
  [grails-x-frame-options-plugin](https://github.com/mrhaki/grails-x-frame-options-plugin)
* This prevents XSS attacks by setting by default the most strict header setting `X-Frame-Options:
  DENY` on all responses from the grails server. You can relax this strict setting to `SAMEORIGIN`
  (and will probably want to) by adding `plugin.xframeoptions.sameOrigin = true` inside the grails
  clause of your application.groovy file (see piq-react for example).

  Windows.
* Default theme is now the 'light' theme.

## v3.0.0

### üí• Breaking Changes

* This release unwinds the multi environment config concept. See #30 for the corresponding issue.
* To take this update, developers need to also migrate to v5.X.X of hoist-react or v2.X.X of
  hoist-sencha and follow these steps in each environment:

#### Step 1

If you are doing this migration in a lower environment (dev, stage, uat) you may want to keep that
environment's configs. For example, if you are migrating the dev env app to this new code, and there
are configs in the dev_value column that you would like to keep in the dev environment, you first
need to manually copy these values from the dev field to the prod field in the dev admin config UI.

#### Step 2

Turn off your grails server and your webpack server (if applicable). Add a new 'value' column with
allow null, allow null in the old 'prod_value' column, then copy prod_value values over to the new
value column:

##### For MySQL DB:

```
ALTER TABLE `xh_config` ADD `value` LONGTEXT;
ALTER TABLE `xh_config` MODIFY `prod_value` LONGTEXT;
```

##### For MS SQL Server DB:

```
ALTER TABLE xh_config
ADD value varchar(max) NULL
ALTER COLUMN prod_value varchar(max)
```

##### For MySQL DB:

```
UPDATE `xh_config` SET `value` = `prod_value`
```

##### For MS SQL Server DB:

```
UPDATE xh_config SET value = prod_value
```

#### Step 3

Update app code in environment to use hoist-core v3.0.0 and hoist-react v5.X.X or hoist-sencha
v2.0.0.

Remove

```
supportedEnvironments = ['Staging', 'Development']
```

from grails-app/conf/application.groovy in your app. (Note that this line might appear twice - once
near the top if an app has customized and once in the "hoistDefaults" section.)

#### Step 4

Set value to not accept NULL and drop old columns:

##### For MySQL DB:

```
ALTER TABLE `xh_config`
  MODIFY `value` LONGTEXT NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE `xh_config`
  DROP COLUMN `beta_value`, `stage_value`, `dev_value`, `prod_value`;
```

##### For MS SQL Server DB:

```
ALTER TABLE xh_config
  ALTER COLUMN value varchar(max) NOT NULL

ALTER TABLE xh_config
  DROP COLUMN prod_value, dev_value, stage_value, beta_value

```

### üéÅ New Features

* None

### üêû Bug Fixes

* None

## v2.0.0

### üí• Breaking Changes

* This release includes updates around how the key `appCode` and `appName` identifiers are read from
  application builds and what they represent. See #33 for the corresponding issue. This standardizes
  the meaning of these two identifiers on the client and server, and decouples the server-side
  appCode from the Gradle project name.
* To take this update, applications must ensure their `build.gradle` file populates these variables
  within a grails.build.info file created by Grails itself during the build. See e.g.
  [this commit to the Toolbox app](https://github.com/xh/toolbox/commit/073376eefba37ea0ffec073478bb628be447c77b)
  for an example of this change.
* Apps should audit their use of `Utils.appName` on the server-side and update to `Utils.appCode` if
  they need to continue accessing the shortname variant.

### üéÅ New Features

* None

### üêû Bug Fixes

* None

## v1.2.0

### üí• Breaking Changes

* None

### üéÅ New Features

This release adds support for
[InstanceConfigUtils](https://github.com/xh/hoist-core/blob/1fa43564fb77e11a04dd075d969b300f38252579/src/main/groovy/io/xh/hoist/util/InstanceConfigUtils.groovy)
, a utility for loading configuration properties from an external YAML file once on startup and
exposing them to the application as a map.

* These are intended to be minimal, low-level configs that apply to a particular deployed instance
  of the application and therefore are better sourced from a local file/volume vs. source code,
  JavaOpts, or database-driven ConfigService entries.
* Examples include the AppEnvironment as well as common Bootstrap requirements such as database
  credentials.
* See the class-level doc comment for additional details. Use of InstanceUtils is _not_ required to
  take this release.

### üêû Bug Fixes

* Fix NPE breaking FeedbackService emailing. 8f07caf677dc0ed3a5ae6c8dd99dc59e2ffd8508
* Make LogLevel adjustments synchronous, so they reflect immediately in Admin console UI.
